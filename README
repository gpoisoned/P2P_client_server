What works?
********************************************************** 
        # clients are able to connect to server via TCP
        # clients can connect/disconnect from peers
        # clients can execute:  
                ls -> displays recent master file list
                get > 
                        get <fileName> command
                        gets the file from the peer. 
                exit -> exits client cleanly and notifies
                        the server so that it can update 
                        its master file list.
        # As clients are added/removed server updates its
                master file list and sends it to all other
                connected clients.
        # If client uses duplicate name, server denies the request
                and so client closes. Server also performs the
                necessary cleanup.
